# JavaScript Virtualization Obfuscation

## Intro
- Describe the attacker scenario
  - Why are code uglyfiers not enough?
  -

## The VM
- register-register and stack architecture
  - Operations operate on registers
  - stack pointer
- How to store strings/arrays
- How to build bytecode functions

### Realizing functions
- call and return operation
- arguments and return values

## Great, so yet another obfuscation scheme?
Well yes kind of, but this one is different.
  - Regular schemes: make it incrementally harder
  - VO: sets the overall bar higher
